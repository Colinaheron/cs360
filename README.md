# cs360
repo for the cs360 class at SNHU
The app I developed is a weight tracking application aimed at helping users monitor their weight progress and achieve their goal weight. It addresses the needs of users who are focused on weight management, whether it's losing weight, maintaining their current weight, or simply tracking their progress as part of a broader health strategy.

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app includes several screens and features:

1. Login/Register Screen: Allows users to create an account or log in to access the app's functionalities.
2. Dashboard: Provides an overview of weight status, progress, and goal setting and allows users to input data.
5. Notifications: Sends alerts to users via SMS when they reach their goal weight.

UI designs were developed with users in mind by ensuring intuitive navigation, clear presentation of data, and minimalistic yet visually appealing interfaces. Designs were successful because they prioritized usability, making it easy for users to access and interact with key features.

In coding the app, I employed techniques such as modular programming, separation of concerns, and object-oriented design to create maintainable and scalable code. These strategies can be applied in future projects to ensure code readability, reusability, and flexibility.

Testing was conducted at various stages of development to ensure code functionality and identify any bugs or issues. This process is crucial for delivering a reliable and user-friendly app, as it helps catch errors early and ensures a smooth user experience.

One area where innovation was required was in implementing SMS notifications for goal achievement. Integrating this feature seamlessly with the app's logic and user interface required creative problem-solving and careful consideration of user privacy and preferences.

In developing the WeightDataSource class to manage database operations, I was able to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in database management, data handling, and software architecture. This component played a central role in the app's functionality and showcased my ability to design and implement robust data management solutions.
